        Please read the following instructions carefully.
        The instructions state everything you need to know in
        order to participate in the experiment. If you have any

    <p>
        You can earn money during the experiment. The amount of money that
        you earn depends on your own choices and the choices of other
        participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The money you earn will be paid out in cash at the end of the
        experiment without other participants being able to see how much
        you earned. Further instructions on this will follow in due time.
        During the experiment you are not allowed to communicate with
        other participants. Turn off your mobile phone and put it in your bag.
        Also, you may only use the functions on the screen that are necessary
        to carry out the experiment. Thank you very much.
